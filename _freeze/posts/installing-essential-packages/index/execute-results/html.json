Once you have a package installed on top base R, you can access all the functions offered by that particular package.\n\nAs of today, there are 18636 packages available in official R package repository ![CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/).\n\nR has a very active & passionate open source community. There are new packages coming up everyday. Often, you can find a package or a function to implement what ever you want.\n\nFor starters, lets install some of useful packages for our data manipulation purposes.\n\nThe first package I load when ever I open up Rstudio is `tidyverse` ‚ù£Ô∏è. `tidyverse` package is a collection of multiple packages üì¶üì¶üì¶ (8 packges to be exact). You will gradually get familiar with tidyverse packages and their functions. Just need to have some patients.. üòå.\n\nType following code in Rstudio console to install tidyverse;\n\n`install.packages(\"tidyverse\")`\n\nThis is how you install any official R package from the package repository.\n\n`install.packages(\"package_name\")`\n\nHowever, sometimes you might find some packages with useful functions which are not on official R repository yet. You can install those packages directly from developers `github` page. To do that, you will need another utility package called `devtools` .\n\nSo, please go ahead and,\n\n`install.packages(\"devtools\")`\n\nWhen I transition form `stata` initially, one thing I missed the most about `stata` is stata's `tab` function. I know you all love `tab` function. Someone has written a R function to mimic stata `tab` but it is not on official repo yet.\n\nNow that you have `devtools` installed, you can grab this package directly from `github`\n\n`devtools::install_github(\"gvelasq/tidytab\")`\n\n‚ùó we have `tab` now ü§ù.\n\nWe will install other packages when we need them. You can do most of the stuff only with `tidyverse`\n\n## Download data\n\nFor our future tutorial I am thinking of using NHANES data (as it is **open** and relevant to us )\n\nI extracted some data from NHANES website (I used this data for a actual study). Please check if you can download it using the following link.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<a href=\"https://github.com/upulcooray/Stat-ClubR/blob/main/resources/nhanes_extracted.rds\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-default hvr-sweep-to-left\"><i class=\"fa fa-save\"></i> Download nhanes_extracted.rds file</button>\n</a>\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
