People in my lab mostly use stata for data analyses. Purpose of this Stat Club is to help them transitions into  gradually.\nNow you must be thinking.. “why listen to this guy 🤔!!”\nI myself is not an  expert. I switched to  (from stata) about 8 months ago simply because I didn’t want to deal with the hazel of stata subcriptions. I started learning R by simply translating my old stata .do into R code. I fell in love 💗 with R ecosystem and tidyverse within few months. Currently, my whole workflow revolve around  (data analyses, writing manuscripts, making presentations, building this blog, and my PhD thesis).\nI will try my best to share my experience stata to R transition experience. And let’s learn some statistics and new methods along the way.\nよろしくお願いします!!!"
