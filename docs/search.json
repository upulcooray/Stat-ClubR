    "text": "Purpose of this blog is to post learning material related to statistical analysis using  and various topics relate to applied statistical methods in epidemiological and public health research in general.\nI started this blog to complement the internal Stat Club in the Department of International Oral Health, Graduate School of Dentistry, Tohoku University, Japan. People in my lab mostly use stata for data analyses. Purpose of this Stat Club is to help them transitions into  gradually.\nNow you must be thinking.. “why listen to this guy 🤔!!”\nI myself is not an  expert. I switched to  (from stata) about a year ago simply because I didn’t want to deal with the hazel of stata subcriptions. I started learning R by simply translating my old stata .do into R code. I fell in 💗 with R ecosystem and tidyverse within few months. Currently, my whole workflow revolve around  (data analyses, writing manuscripts, making presentations, building this blog, and my PhD thesis).\nI will try my best to share my stata to R transition experience. And let’s learn some statistics and new methods along the way.\n🙏 よろしくお願いします!!!"

    "text": "You need R language installed in your PC to start coding in R. Default graphical user interface of R is not very pleasant to work with.\nLooks like this..!\n\nAlmost all R users use an alternative IDE known as R-studio which makes your R learning a much pleasant experience. We will explore Rstudio features later.\nR studio looks like this!\n\n\n\nThis is me creating this post in Rstudio 😃\n\n\nInstallation of R and Rstudio is very simple!\nStep 1: Go to r-project website [click here] and download the installer for your PC’s OS.\nStep 2: Execute the installer with all the default settings (make sure R is install into the PATH - normally this is the default behavior)\nStep 3: Navigate to this page and download the Rstudio installer for your PC’s OS and run it.\nNow you are all set to start coding in R…!!!\nCheck your installation by opening Rstudio and just typing 1 + 1 in the console window and press Enter key.\n\n\n\nlike this\n\n\nNow you are ready to start learning R…! 👍"
