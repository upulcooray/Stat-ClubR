I hope everyone was able to install R and Rstudio successfully!

Now your R installation has loaded with some functions (we will talk about functions in greater depth later..) these functions are capable of performing a particular computation.

For example `sqrt()` function can computes square root of any number you type within those brackets (identical to `stata` ðŸ˜ƒ)

These default functions that come with R installation are known as [Base R functions]{.red}.

However, the versatility of R comes from it's external packages ðŸ“¦.

A package simply a collection of functions. Once you have a package installed on top base R, you can access all the functions offered by that particular package.

As of today, there are 18636 packages are available in official R package repository (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/).

R has a very active & passionate open source community. They create new packages everyday. Often you can find a package or a function to implement what ever you want.
