## Welcome to session 1

Today we will start by familiarizing ourselves with Rstudio interface.

First, I want you to apply some setting in the Rstudio;

Please go to `Tools -> Global options`

Make sure settings in red circled areas are similar to as shown in the picture above (this prevents some future headaches when you work on a project)

I will walk you through the Rstudio interface main features. You will become very familiar with it once we start actual data analysis.

Then, I will introduce my workflow in starting a new project and why I do that. This might not be optimal for you all, once you are familiar with the R environment feel free to adapt your own method.

1.  Usually, I always create a dedicated R project for all my projects. Let's all create a R project for this stat club.

you will also have to understand little bit about

1.  Creating sub folders
2.  Understanding project root directory
3.  Understand how to use relative paths (this makes your project portable .. meaning you can just copy and past you project anywhere and nothing will break)

`excersice 1` : create a folder name `data` within you stat club project and move `nhanes_extracted.rds` file into that folder.

(download link for data is in <https://upulcooray.github.io/Stat-ClubR/posts/installing-essential-packages/> )

Then, let's create our first R script. R scripts are similar to `stata .do file` . R script files has `.R` extension at the end ( I usually keep R scrips in a separate folder within the peoject)

To check our understanding of relative paths, lets try to summon `nhanes_extracted.rds` file which is located within data folder using a R script named `basics.R`

we can use `readRDS()` function for this purpose.

> note: `.rds` is a R specific data format you can save any object in your R environment as a `.rds` file. I used .rds file to distribute data because the file size of `.rds` is significantly less compared to `.csv`

If there is enough time lets talk little bit about R data types as well.
