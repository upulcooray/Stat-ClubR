**Welcome to Stat ClubR blog!**

Purpose of this blog is to post learning material related to statistical analysis using `r fa("r-project")` and various topics relate to applied statistical methods in epidemiological and public health research in general.

I started this blog to complement the internal Stat Club in the [*Department of International Oral Health, Graduate School of Dentistry, Tohoku University, Japan*](http://www.dent.tohoku.ac.jp/english/research/international_oral_health.html){style="color:gray;"}*.* People in my lab mostly use **`stata`** for data analyses. Purpose of this **Stat Club** is to help them transitions into `r fa("r-project")` gradually.

***Now you must be thinking.. "why listen to this guy 🤔!!"***

I myself is **not an** `r fa("r-project")` **expert**. I switched to `r fa("r-project")` (from stata) about a year ago simply because I didn't want to deal with the hazel of stata subcriptions. I started learning R by simply translating my old stata `.do` into `R code`. I fell in 💗 with R ecosystem and `tidyverse` within few months. Currently, my whole workflow revolve around `r fa("r-project")` (data analyses, writing manuscripts, making presentations, building this blog, and my PhD thesis).

I will try my best to share my stata to R transition experience. And let's learn some statistics and new methods along the way.

🙏 よろしくお願いします!!!
